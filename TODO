This is a loosely-categorized list of outstanding tasks and ideas for improving
this package. When implementing any of these, please include an update to this
TODO file removing that task, in the same commit.

* Create SH capture plugin. This is essentially the same as the v4l2src plugin
but would use buffers allocated downstream (e.g. by the SH video encoder) and
use the USERPTR v4l2 capture method.

The following were previously listed and need to be checked:
* make gst-sh-video-cap send NEWSEGMENT events.
* capsneg is broken
* potential race condition -- videoenc.c:463 -- needs investigation
