This is a loosely-categorized list of outstanding tasks and ideas for improving
this package. When implementing any of these, please include an update to this
TODO file removing that task, in the same commit.

* Modify video encoder to support GST_TYPE_SH_VIDEO_BUFFER input buffers so that
it can connect to other SH elements without performing a memcpy.

* Create SH capture plugin. This is essentially the same as the v4l2 src plugin
but would allocate memory from UIOMux and use the USERPTR v4l2 capture method.
The output buffers would use GST_TYPE_SH_VIDEO_BUFFER so that other SH elements
can use the captured buffers without performing a memcpy.

* Create an SH video blend/overlay plugin.

* make gst-sh-video-cap send NEWSEGMENT events.

* capsneg is broken

* potential race condition -- videoenc.c:463 -- needs investigation
